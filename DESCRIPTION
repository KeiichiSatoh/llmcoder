Description: This package facilitates the integration of large language models (LLMs), 
    such as ChatGPT, into qualitative data processing and coding workflows. 
    It provides wrapper functions to streamline interaction between data.frame 
    objects—a standard data structure in R—and LLM-based APIs.
